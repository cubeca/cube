        Services safe and welcoming for everyone.

        Cube Commons is home to a wide variety of Content, and not all of it is
        appropriate for Minors. Our Creators rate their Content as “All Ages” or
        “Mature” as part of uploading it to us. Content rated “All Ages” is
        appropriate for everyone. It can be accessed by anyone using Cube
        Services. “Mature” content is intended for people 18 and older. To
        access Content our Creators have rated “Mature”, you must either create
        an account or confirm you are 18 or older. If you believe you have found
        Content that has been rated inappropriately, you can report it to us.
      </p>
      <h5>4.3. Reports</h5>
      <p>
        If you believe a Community Member, Creator, or Content is in violation
        of the Code of Conduct, or that Content has not been rated
        appropriately, you can report it to us by email
        <a href="mailto:ash@cubecommons.ca">ash@cubecommons.ca</a>. Cube Commons
        reviews all Reports and keeps records of steps taken to address them.

        Cube Commons reserves the right to take any steps we believe are
        necessary to enforce our Terms, including our Code of Conduct. Cube
        Commons may, without limitation, suspend accounts, remove Profiles or
        parts of Profiles, delete Playlists, or delete or hide Content if, in
        our sole discretion, we believe such measures are necessary.

        such damages.
      </p>
      <h5>6.3. Severability</h5>

        If any term or provision of these Terms, including the Creator Terms, is
        found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
        a finding shall not affect any other term or provision of the Terms or
        invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other

      </p>
      <h4>7. Cube DAO Terms</h4>
      <h5>7.1. Application</h5>
      <p>
        This section 7 (“Cube DAO Terms”) applies only to participants in the
        Cube Commons governance DAO (“Cube DAO”) and holders of the Cube Commons
        governance token (“Governance Token”). If any part of the Cube DAO Terms
        conflicts with any other part of these Terms or the Creator Terms, the
        provisions of the Cube DAO Terms take precedence.
      </p>
      <h5>7.2. Cube DAO</h5>
      <p>
        Cube Commons makes many decisions through the Cube DAO by vote using
        Governance Tokens granted to members of the Cube Commons and to Creators
        who upload Content to Cube Services.
      </p>
      <h5>7.3. Governance Rights</h5>
      <p>
        The governance rights associated with the Cube DAO and Governance Tokens
        (“Governance Rights”) are subject to the bylaws of the Society for Cube
        Commons, the requirements of the British Columbia Societies Act, and to
        decisions made by the Cube Parties or the Cube DAO. Governance Rights
        may be changed at any time, and may be made without notice to the Cube
        DAO or Governance Token holders.
      </p>
      <h5>7.4. Governance Only</h5>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that Governance Tokens are solely for
        governance purposes, and do not represent any ownership interest,
        security interest, or other proprietary right, interest, or claim in or
        to Cube Commons, the Cube Services, or the Content available through
        Cube Services.
      </p>
      <h5>7.5. Voting</h5>
      <p>
        The Cube DAO allows two kinds of voting: one vote per Governance Token
        (“Token Vote”) or one vote per Governance Token holder (“Token Holder
        Vote”). Voting outcomes are based on votes cast. A majority is over 50%
        of votes cast and a supermajority is over 67% of votes cast.
      </p>
      <h5>7.6. No Value</h5>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that Governance Tokens have no monetary or
        exchange value, and may not be bought, sold, traded, bartered,
        delegated, gifted, or otherwise exchanged. Cube Commons and the Cube
        Parties are not responsible to Governance Token holders for any
        perceived change in the value of the Governance Token or in the scope of
        Governance Rights.
      </p>
      <h5>7.7. Security</h5>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for the security and safekeeping of your
        Governance Tokens and the credentials required to access your Governance
        Tokens and the Governance Rights associated with those Governance
        Tokens. Cube Commons and the Cube Parties have no responsibility to
        assist with recovering lost or stolen Governance Tokens or credentials.
      </p>
      <h5>7.8. Documentation</h5>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for setting up and maintaining the technical
        systems required to hold Governance Tokens and to make use of the
        associated Governance Rights. Cube Commons may provide documentation or
        links to third party websites or other materials (“Documentation”) for
        the convenience of Governance Token holders. Cube Commons is not
        responsible for the accuracy, utility, or completeness of such
        Documentation, or for any of the software or hardware products mentioned
        in the Documentation. For greater certainty, the disclaimers and
        limitations of liability set out above apply to any Documentation
        provided by Cube Commons.
      </p>
      <h5>7.9. Malicious Use</h5>
      <p>
        Cube Commons may, in its sole discretion, withhold, revoke, or
        invalidate Governance Tokens or membership in the Cube DAO if it or the
        Cube DAO determines that: a) the Governance Tokens are being used in a
        manner that undermines the intended governance structure of the Cube
        DAO, b) a Creator is abusing the Governance Token reward mechanism, or
        c) a Creator is using the Cube DAO, the Governance Tokens, or the
        Governance Token reward mechanism in a manner that undermines the
        intended operation of the Cube DAO or the proper allotment of Governance
        Rights.
