  "daoText": "CubeCommons operates like a DAO—which is a decentralized autonomous organization made possible by blockchain technology—while fulfilling the requirements of a not-for-profit. This means that all content creators on CubeCommons are collective owners of the platform. CubeCommons does not produce a publicly traded token, only an internal governance token that CubeCommons creators earn for uploading free, accessible content. They use their governance tokens to vote on improvements to the site and the managing of CubeCommons’s assets. By using an on-chain voting system, we make these decisions public. Cube, unlike other streaming platforms, does not sell your data. The art organizations here are dedicated to online ecosystems that engage with audiences and creators in equitable ways.",

  "nftsText": "<0>We could not hang out with all these great artists and art organizations and not make art! While we are not an NFT marketplace, we do subsidize gas and other minting fees for artists collaborating with organizations to produce an NFT. The sale and re-sale of these NFTs online, automatically sends profits back to the artists, the organizations and Cube to help create another avenue toward sustainability.</0><1>For decades artists have been producing limited edition multiples for galleries to sell as part of their funding model. However, the sale and resale of these works has not provided income for their artists. We look to blockchain to improve the equity of these collaborations with organizations, and to help artists into a new medium for their work.</1>",
